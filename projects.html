        <p>A web project is the process of developing and creating a Web site, activities in a network which are aimed
            at a pre-defined goal. The network can be both accessible for everyone, as in the Internet, or only for
            certain people, as an intranet. The goal of Web projects is the transfer of static and dynamic content -
            both directly to end users, as well as indirectly through means of various kinds of interfaces. Web projects
            are based on TCP/IP (Transfer Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) technology and concern the transfer of
            static and dynamic content.
